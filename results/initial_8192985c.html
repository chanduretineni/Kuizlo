<h2>English 201 Activity: Editing for Style, Usage, and Grammar with Generative AI</h2>

<h3>Learning Objectives</h3>
<p>To be able to effectively edit written business messages for errors in style, usage, and grammar while maintaining human agency and authorship over your message.</p>

<h3>Instructions</h3>
<p>Work individually for this assignment. Read the sample email below. Use a generative AI tool (e.g., ChatGTP, DeepSeek, Grammarly) to:</p>
<ol class="instruction-list">
    <li>Identify errors in style, usage, and grammar.</li>
    <li>Suggest edits.</li>
</ol>
<p>Follow and complete the “AI Prompting Protocol” provided below the email. Do NOT simply have AI revise the entire email. Submit to the Moodle portal, “Editing for Style, Usage, Grammar with AI.”</p>

    <h3>Email</h3>
    <p><strong>Subject:</strong> Clarification on Project Details and Deadlines</p>
    <p>Dear Abu Omar,</p>
    <p>I hope you’re doing well. I’m reaching out to you regarding the project we’re currently working on. I wanted to confirm some of the project’s specifics, as there seems to be a bit of confusion about the deliverables. For example, are we expected to submit the final report by the end of next week or is there a different due date that I should be aware of? Also, I’m not entirely clear if the presentation part is supposed to be done individually or in groups. Can you clarify whether the group collaboration is required for the report itself, or if we should be working on it separately? I’d also appreciate clarification on whether we need to submit progress updates as we move forward, or if just the final version of everything is required at the end.</p>
    <p>In addition, I’m also wondering about the formatting of the report and any specific guidelines that we should follow. If you could confirm the exact expectations for this, I’d be very grateful. I know you’ve mentioned some things in the meetings, but I want to make sure I’m aligned with your expectations. Looking forward to hearing from you soon, and thanks in advance for your guidance.</p>
    <p>Best regards,<br>Mohammad</p>

<h3>AI Prompting Protocol</h3>
<ol class="protocol-list">
    <li>Enter the following instruction into the text input field (the area where you type your prompt or query): “Identify the errors in style, usage, and grammar in the following email:” After this, paste the entire email below the instruction. Submit the prompt (or press Enter) to trigger the AI to process your request and generate a response. Cut-and-paste the identified errors generated by AI into a Word document.</li>
    <li>Next, in the same feed on the AI platform, enter the following instruction into the text input field: “Make suggested edits to some of these compositional errors.” Submit the prompt. You may need to do additional prompting to ensure that the AI platform did NOT simply rewrite the email for you. Cut-and-paste the suggested edits generated by AI into the same Word document.</li>
</ol>
<p>You should have two sections: (a) the identified compositional errors; (b) the suggested edits next to the original sentences.</p>
